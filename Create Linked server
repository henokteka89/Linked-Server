Linked server

Setting up a linked server between two SQL Server instances (henok and henok\test) 

1. Create the Linked Server:
•	In SSMS, expand the Server Objects node in Object Explorer.
•	Right-click Linked Servers and choose New Linked Server.
 
2. Linked Server Properties:
•	Linked Server: Enter the name for the linked server. This can be any name you choose.
•	Server Type: Choose SQL Server.
•	Server Name: Enter Henok\Test (the name of the instance you want to link to).
     
3. Security: Configure the security settings under the Security tab.
•	Be made using this security context: Use this if you want to specify a SQL Server login for the connection. Provide the login and password for a user on henok\test.
•	Impersonate: This option allows the linked server to use the credentials of the currently connected user. This requires that the user has access to both instances.

The SQL LOGIN must exist in the destination (henok\test) with necessary permissions to access database. If it is given db_reader permission to admin database, it can’t do write. If the permission is only for admin database, it can’t access other databases. 
  
4. SERVER Options: Adjust provider options under the Server Options tab.
•	Ensure that Data Access, RPC and RPC Out are set to True if you plan to run stored procedures on the remote server.
 
Test the Connection: After configuring the linked server, test the connection by expanding the linked server node in Object Explorer or running a test query.
 
Test with a Simple Query:
SELECT * FROM [LinkedServerName].[DatabaseName].[SchemaName].[TableName]

Troubleshooting
Problem: server ABC\TESTENV' is not configured for DATA ACCESS.
Solution: Go to SERVER Options and enable “Data Access” by changing it to TRUE.
